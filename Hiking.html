    <p><i>Glacier</i> Experience is a small group
    experience that offers an easy glacier

    <p>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is
      surrounded by some of Iceland's grand volcanoes and during summertime, a
      glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charms of the
      location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with
       the true reason behind the name Ice-land!</p>
